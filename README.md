# ECG signal conditioning by Morphological Filtering\
\
> Project developed for the biomedical signal processing class over winter 2022-2023\
\
The full explanation on how to run the code and the methodology adopted to conduct the conditioning and to evaluate its performances are described in how_to_run.pdf.\
\
The only difference is that the whole code is not provided in the folder named \'93project_matteo_castagna\'94, still all the .m files need to share the same directory and demo.m need to be run while Matlab ambient is set to its folder.}
